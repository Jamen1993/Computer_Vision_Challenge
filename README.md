The task was to create a program in Matlab that takes 2 images and renders a virtual view from a camera positioned between the two real cameras. The virtual camera pose should be settable with a factor in the range 0 .. 1 where 0 corresponds to the pose of camera 1 and 1 corresponds to the position of camera 2 and everything in between should be interpolated linearly.
